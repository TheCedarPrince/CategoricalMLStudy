        "# Example of OMOP CDM Data\n\n## Small Background\n\n> Disclaimer: Section co-written with ChatGPT\n\nThe Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) is a database schema and standard designed to facilitate the processing of healthcare data from electronic health records, health information exchanges, and electronic medical records.\nInformation about the schema is here: https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54.html but the Entity-Relationship Diagram looks like this:\n\n![](assets/cdm54.png)\n\nSome of the most important tables in the OMOP CDM are as follows:\n\n1. `person`: Contains unique identifiers for individuals, including demographics \n2. `condition_occurrence`: Records diagnoses or health conditions, along with their start and end dates.\n3. `procedure_occurrence`: Documents procedures performed on patients, including surgical and diagnostic interventions.\n4. `drug_exposure`: Contains information on drug prescriptions, including drug names, dosages, and start/end dates.\n\nEach table is linked through common identifiers (such as `person_id` and various `_occurrence_id` variables), enabling comprehensive analysis. \n\n## Dependency Set-Up"
